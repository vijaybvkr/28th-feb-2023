      <p><b>Weightlifting </b><i>(often known as Olympic weightlifting)</i>, is a sport in which athletes compete in lifting a barbell loaded with weight plates from the ground to overhead, with each athlete trying to successfully lift the heaviest weights. Athletes compete in two specific ways of lifting the barbell overhead: these are the snatch and the clean and jerk. The snatch is a wide-grip lift, in which the weighted barbell is lifted overhead in one motion. The clean and jerk is a combination lift, in which the weight is first taken from the ground to the front of the shoulders (the clean), and then from the shoulders to overhead (the jerk).<br>
      <mark>Each weightlifter gets three attempts at both the snatch and the clean and jerk, with the snatch attempts being done first. An athlete's score is the combined total of the highest successfully-lifted weight in kilograms for each lift</mark>. Athletes compete in various weight classes, which are different for each sex and have changed over time.
      <br>Weightlifting is an olympic sport, and has been contested in every Summer Olympic Games since <sub><del>1918</del></sub><sup><del>1919</del></sup> 1920. Whilst the sport is officially named "weightlifting", the terms "olympic<small> weightlifting</small>" and "olympic-style weightlifting" are often used to distinguish it from the other sports and events that involve the lifting of weights, such as powerlifting, weight training, and strongman events. Similarly, the snatch and clean-and-jerk are known as the "olympic lifts".</p>
