	<hr>
	<p><b>Lepakshi</b> is a village in the <del>anantapur</del><i>Sri Sathya Sai district</i> of Andhra Pradesh, India.[2] <mark>It is located 15 km (9.3 mi) east of Hindupur and approximately 82 km (51 mi) west of Kadiri and 120 km (75 mi) north of Bangalore</mark>.Veerabhadra temple is a Hindu temple located in the Lepakshi, in the state of Andhra <small>Pradesh</small>, India. The temple is dedicated to the Virabhadra, a fierce incarnation of Lord Shiva. Built in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, the architectural features of the temple are in the Vijayanagara style with profusion of carvings and paintings at almost every exposed surface of the temple. <br>The guide whipped out a twig from his shirt pocket with a flourish and said dramatically: <mark>“Now I show you best part of Lepakshi temple.”</mark> He got down on his knees before the large grey pillar before us. Bending forward, he passed the twig slowly under the pillar. From one end to the other! There was an audible gasp from the group of tourists, mostly Europeans, as the twig emerged from the other side. He repeated the exercise with a page of an old grimy newspaper which he pulled out from another pocket.</p>
